# Traffic_Sign_Classification

In this project, we will use a convoltional Neural network to build train, 
and test a traffic sign classification Model. 
We will build this model using tenserflow and keras it is a multiclass classification
problem. This model can be used to make smarter cars.

After this project, you will be able to create a multiclass Classification model using Deeplearning.

The steps to solve the problem:

1. Finding data on kaggle and loading it into collab
2. Preprocessing the images and visualizing them
3. Finding out the mean of the dimension and resizing all images accordingly
4. Converting the images into a numpy array and normalize them.
5. checking class imbalance.
6. Splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding
7. Creating the model Archetecture, Compiling the model and then fitting it
8. plotting the Accuracy and loss against each epoch.
9. Preprocessing the test data and make predictions on it.
10. Visualizing the original and predected labels for the test images
